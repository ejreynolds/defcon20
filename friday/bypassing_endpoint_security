Standard Device Classes:
  - HID
  - Printer
  - Audio
  - Mass Storage Devices

Endpoint:
  - Virtual wire for USB connection
  - Unidirectional
  - Packet fragmentation, handshaking, etc done by hardware (usually)
  - High bit of address tells direction (1=in,0=out)
  - Types of endpoings:
    * Control
    * Bulk transport
    * Interrupt
    * isochronous

Control Endpoints:
  - Pirmary mech for most devices to comunicate with host
  - Every device must have at least one in and out control enpoint EP0
  - Device must respond to standard equests
    * get/set address, descriptors, power and status
  - Device may respond to class specific requests
  - 3 transport stages: setup, data, status
 
 Bulk Endpoints:
  - No latency guarantees
  - Good perf on idle bus
  - Superceeded by all other transport types
  - Full (8-64byte packets) & high-speed (512 byte packets only)
  - Used extensively in USB flash drives (and ext. hard drives)

Descriptors:
  - The describe things
  - Have a standard format
    * 1st byte is the length in bytes
    * 2nd byte determines type of descriptor
    * Remaining bytes are descriptor itself
  - Common types
    * device: tells you basic info about the device
    * Configuration
    * etc
