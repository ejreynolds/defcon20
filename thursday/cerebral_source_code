* "Be nice" == can get what you want.
* Finite number of opening chess moves.  Similar to social situations.
* "The social contract"
* Epicurian ethics: "neither harm, nor be harmed"
* Mazlow's hierachy of need
* When you can identify a need somebody has, fulfilling one of their needs (as mentioned above) automatically indebts them to you.
* Managing assets = tough
* When you enter into it, you open yourself up as a target
** (good way to combat that? meet them halfway)
* Big rule of social engineering: never be more than 50% full of shit!
* Becoming a perceived expert:
** injecting information when knowledge was requested.  ie. giving directions to bathroom: "oh and there's this great pizza place on the way..."

# Random notes:
** "The Power of non-sexual touch" -- good book
** Never social engineering for over-deserved ends (i.e. getting 1 beer versus getting a 6-pack)
** "Maybe you can help me" - very effective opening.  gives them an opportunity to be the hero.
** Always look like you're supposed to be there.  Always look like you know what you're doing.
** Don't be afraid to tell somebody you're too busy for their interruption.
** Non-sequitors are awesome
** Ask for more information to avoid tough questions.
