The Darknet of Things: Building Sensor Networks to do our bidding.

Sensor Networks
  - take information
  - pass it around
  - sometime compute
  - send it back to central node

6LowPAN
  - 802.15.4 (Yup, runs on top of ZigBee MAC)
    * IPv6 for low power wireless
    * Advantages
      - very very large address space
      - all addressable
      - all pingable
    * Limitations
      - high latency
      - low bandwidth
    
A Darknet of Things
  - Build the largest free-roaming sensor network in the world (DC21?)

Considerations
  - No Arduino!
  - Processors aren't really powerful to do anything interesting anyways
  - Must be hackable!

The Hardware (Darknet Badge)
  - 2 ARM Microprocessors (1 main, 1 network)
  - USB (2 ports, host and client)
  - 2.8" TFT Touch Screen
  - 6LowPan Network Connectivity
  - Battery Powered and Rechargable
  - TFT Controller
  - SD Card slot
  - JTAG Header
  - Network only development boards
    * Designed to be attached to and drive you rpojects
    * UARTs, SPI, I2c(?) exposed
    * 1 x MC1322v
    * JTAG Header
  - McMote
    * 1" circle
    * Chip + battery + LED
    * CR2032 powered
    * UART for expansion (direct FT232R module compat)
  - DevBoards and APs
    * MC13224v to Ethernet (McNic)
      - Small form factor
      - AP style operation
        * 6LowPAN -> Ethernet

  -McMote = ~$15 BOM in small quantity
