The End of the PSTN As You Know It
ViperLab (www.viperlab.net) - Aqcuired by Avaya

Why do we have to go through a carrier to talk to other VoIP peers?

ENUM DNS Record
  - Maps E.164 tele numbers to a SIP URI
  - Low adoption

SIP Peering using DNS SRV
  - Everybody use DNS for SIP Peering
    * cna intercon all "islands of VOIP" directly between orgs using DNS
    * DNS build for HA and load balancing
  - There's an RFC for using this for SIP.
  - DNS SRV load balancing

Measure growth of SIP peering on IPv4, over time.
  - Prolif of DNS SRV records
  - Prolif of ENUM records

enumerator
  - enumerator.sourceforge.net
  - Can be used for R&D and VoIP pen testing
  - Partial support for Microsoft targets

292 million domains

8.7 million domains support SIP via DNS SRV

Can do e.164 numbers and returns the SIP address (if found)

UC Federation
  - Cisco
    * Uses PSTN initially
  - Microsoft
    * Lync!
    * They did their research on it
  - Matt Landis' Federation Directory
    * 9705 domains 
      - Canada, USA, Norway
  - LyncDirectory.com

Lync Federation Types
  - Dynamic (SRV Discovery)
  - Enhanced / Direct Federation (Whitelist)
  - Blacklist

LyncSpoof
  - Acts as a legitimate Lync client and connects to Lync front-end server
  - Uses NTLM auth and message signing
  - Can be used to flood and lock up a Lync client

Federator
  - Acts as a legitimate Lync Server and connects to another Lync Server via Federation
  - Requires a cert from a Public CA

SIP TLS Proxy Tool
  - Objective 1: Decrypt the SIP TLS message flow and learn how it works (complete)
  - Objective 2: Fiddle with it, resign, and continue traffic flow

Open Source UC Federation
  - Can be used for inexpensive and out of band ocmmunication between groups of friends.
  - Can be used for audio, video, and instant messaging
  - Saves money by using open source software for servers and end points
  - Similar architecture to Lync, without the sepearte frontend/backend servers.
  - SIP TLS / SRTP for privacy
  - Asterisk Federation
    * SRV Lookups
    * No need for SIP trunks to terminate calls at the PSTN
    * This means no long distance / international fees between federated users

SIP Federation Project
  - Linodes!
  - Configuration files available at the enumerator website.

Conclusion
  - IP QoS
    * Fantastic quality on WiFi, 3G, etc.
    * B2BUA - Back to Back user agent
      - RTP Media Anchoring
      - Poor Man's SBC
    * Host your own SIP for your organization using DNS SRV using your domain (on a $20 / linode)
    * Peer directly to other organizations
    * Keep your carrier SIP trunk, for access to legacy PSTN
