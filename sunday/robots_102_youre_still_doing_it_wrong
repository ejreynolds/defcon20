Robots 102, You're still doing it wrong

Input is hard
  - IR sucks with mirrors
  - Modern cameras emit a ton of IR and break all the things
    * Sunglasses = filter IR
  - Ultrasonic Rangefinder
    * Suck with fuzzy things
  - Perception of reality is difficult
    * Don't take raw data!
  - The walls bend
    * Beams bounce, make corner look farther away
  - LIDAR
    * Awesome!
    * Expensive
    * Want to fix that second bit
  - Don't mount your compass next to your motor :-P
  - PID Concept
    * Proportion
    * Integration
    * Derivative

    ap + bi + cd = output

  - Velocity control
    * Set the i multiplier to zero
  - Servos
    * Limited to one rotation
    * just tell them to the position and they go
  - Pneumatics
    * Use air
    * open system
    * barring expensive things only have two positions
  - Hydraulics
    * Messy when broken
    * Many positions
    * closed system
  - Can use camera phone to check IR
    * Make sure your camera phone doesn't have an IR filter
  - 4 bar linkages are awesome
  - Know your substrates when using adhesives! (duh)
